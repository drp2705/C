							Module 2 – Introduction to Programming
							Overview of C Programming

THEORY EXERCISE:

Que.. Write an essay covering the history and evolution of C programming. Explain
      its importance and why it is still used today.

-->  Introduction :
     C programming language stands as one of the most influential and enduring programming languages in Programming Side.
     known for its efficiency, flexibility and many more.

--> Evolution :
    The story of C begins in the early 1970s at Bell Labs (AT&T Bell Telephone Laboratories). Before C, programmers used languages like Assembly
    and BCPL (Basic Combined Programming Language).
    In 1967, Martin Richards developed BCPL, which influenced the development of another language called B, created by Ken Thompson in 1969.

Setting Up Environment : 

THEORY EXERCISE:

Que.. Describe the steps to install a C compiler (e.g., GCC) and set up an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like DevC++, VS Code, or 
      Codeblocks.

-->  Download MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows):

	Go to the MinGW-w64 website:
	👉 https://www.mingw-w64.org/
	Or download from SourceForge:
	👉 https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/

	Install MinGW:

	Run the installer.

	Choose architecture: x86_64 (for 64-bit) or i686 (for 32-bit).

	Choose threads: posix, exception: seh (recommended for 64-bit).

	Set installation directory (e.g., C:\mingw-w64).

	Add GCC to System Path:

	Open Environment Variables from Control Panel.

	Edit the Path variable and add:
	Example:
	C:\mingw-w64\bin

	This allows you to use GCC commands like gcc from anywhere in the Command Prompt.

	Verify Installation:

	Open Command Prompt and type:

	gcc --version

	If installed correctly, it will show GCC version info

	
	Installing and Setting Up Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
	
	Download and Install VS Code:

	Official site: 👉 https://code.visualstudio.com/

	Download the installer for your OS and install it.

	Install C/C++ Extension:

	Open VS Code.

	Go to Extensions (Ctrl + Shift + X).

	Search for "C/C++" by Microsoft and install it.

	
LAB EXERCISE:
	Install a C compiler on your system and configure the IDE. Write your first
	program to print "Hello, World!" and run it.

-->     #include <stdio.h>
	int main()
	{
    	printf("Hello, World!\n");
    	return 0;
	}
