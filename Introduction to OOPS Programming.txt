Introduction to C++ – Understanding the Basics of Programming


* What is Programming?

--.> Programming is the process of writing instructions for a computer to perform tasks. These instructions are written in a programming language.


* Why C++?

-->  C++ is a widely-used, general-purpose programming language known for:

-->  Efficiency and speed

-->  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) features

-->  Compatibility with hardware-level manipulation

-->  Use in systems, games, and application development


* Features of C++:

-->  Combines procedural and object-oriented features

-->  Allows low-level memory manipulation

-->  Supports functions, classes, inheritance, polymorphism


* Introduction to C++ Language

-->  C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C language with object-oriented features.

Basic structure of a C++ program:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}


* POP Vs OOP

* Procedural Oriented Programming (POP)

    Focuses on functions and procedures

    Example: C language

    Code is structured around procedures

* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

   Focuses on objects and classes

   Example: C++

   Code is structured around real-world entities

* Advantages of OOP

--> Encapsulation → Data and methods are bundled together

--> Inheritance → Code reuse across classes

--> Polymorphism → One interface, many implementations

--> Abstraction → Hides complexity, shows only essentials

--> Modularity → Code is divided into classes and objects
