Q.    What is Program ?
-- >  A program is a set of instructions that a computer follows in order to perform a particular task.

LAB EXERCISE: Write a simple "Hello World" program in two different programming languages of
	      your choice. Compare the structure and syntax.

	   ->
		First we write program in HTML :
				
		<!DOCTYPE html>
		<html lang="en">
		<head>
    		<meta charset="UTF-8">
    		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    		<title>First Page</title>
		</head>
		<body>

		    ! Hello World !

		</body>
		</html>


	    ->  Second we write program in C :

	        #include<stdio.h>
		int main()
		{
			printf("Hello World");

		return 0;
		}

THEORY EXERCISE: Explain in your own words what a program is and how it functions.
	      -> A program is a set of instructions that tells computer what to do.
	      -> It contains code written in a programming language which may be interpreted, compiled or assembled into machine readable form and then executed.

Q.   What is Programming?
-->  Programming is set of instructions given to machine.

THEORY EXERCISE: What are the key steps involved in the programming process?

Types of Programming Languages : High level Programming Language 0 - 9
				 Low Level Programming Language [ Machine Level Programming Language 0 - 1 (Binary)]


THEORY EXERCISE: What are the main differences between high-level and low-level 
		 programming languages?
	    -->  High level Programming Language [0-9] it is understood by human and
		 Low Level Programming Language [Machine Level Programming Language 0-1 (Binary)] it is understood by machine
